title: "Equitable Public Bus Network Optimization for Social Good: A Case Study of Singapore"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-facct-equitable
excerpt: 'This work is the first work on equitable bus network optimization. In this work, we formulated the first-ever notion of bus network equity. We then explored several model's performance on bus network optimization in terms of both bus network efficiency and equity.'

Similar trajectory search is a crucial task that facilitates many downstream spatial data analytic applications. Despite its importance, many of the current literature focus solely on the trajectory’s spatial similarity while neglecting the temporal information. Additionally, the few papers that use both the spatial and temporal features based their approach on a traditional point-to-point comparison. These methods model the importance of the spatial and temporal aspect of the data with only a single, pre-defined balancing factor for all trajectories, even though the relative spatial and temporal balance can change from trajectory to trajectory. In this article, we propose the first spatio-temporal, deep-representation-learning-based approach to similar trajectory search. Experiments show that utilizing both features offers significant improvements over existing point-to-point comparison and deep-representation-learning approach. We also show that our deep neural network approach is faster and performs more consistently compared to the point-to-point comparison approaches.
