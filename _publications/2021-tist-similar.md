Similar trajectory search is a crucial task that facilitates many downstream spatial data analytic applications. Despite its importance, many of the current literature focus solely on the trajectoryâ€™s spatial similarity while neglecting the temporal information. Additionally, the few papers that use both the spatial and temporal features based their approach on a traditional point-to-point comparison. These methods model the importance of the spatial and temporal aspect of the data with only a single, pre-defined balancing factor for all trajectories, even though the relative spatial and temporal balance can change from trajectory to trajectory. In this article, we propose the first spatio-temporal, deep-representation-learning-based approach to similar trajectory search. Experiments show that utilizing both features offers significant improvements over existing point-to-point comparison and deep-representation-learning approach. We also show that our deep neural network approach is faster and performs more consistently compared to the point-to-point comparison approaches.
