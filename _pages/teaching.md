### [Programming Studio 1 (COSC2803)](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/054081)

### RMIT University

In this course, students explore how to build software, through learning how to build a simple fully functional data-driven website. Students learn about fundamental concepts in User-Centred Design (UX/UI) and Database System that explore the front-end-to-back-end of software development. 

April 2023 - June 2023

### [Performance Management Foundations (MANU2469)](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/browse/;CURPOS=1?STYPE=ENTIRE&CLOCATION=Study+at+RMIT%2F&QRY=%2Btype%3Dflexible+%2Bsubtype%3Dheparta+%2Bkeywords%3D%28MANU2469%29+&course=MANU2469&title=&Search=Search)

### RMIT University (Online)

In this course students learn how to analyse data captured from engineering enterprises and systems. Students will be introduced to the key planning and control mechanisms for effective outcome and performance management. Students will also learn the general principles and methodologies of data analysis and statistics which form the basis for modelling of engineering systems

February 2023 - April 2023

### [Programming Studio 1 (COSC2801)](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/054079)

### RMIT University

This course introduces programming in a bootcamp style using Java. This course covers algorithmic development using standard control structures, fundamental concepts of programming and creation of small to medium practical applications. In this course students will learn the basic skills of program development by working on the production of small amounts of software. This will include skills in testing and debugging programs, and in the use of appropriate software technologies. 

February 2023 - June 2023

### [Programming and Software Development (COMP90041)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2017/subjects/comp90041)

### The University of Melbourne

This subject is aimed for students to develop an understanding of approaches to solving moderately complex problems with computers, and to be able to demonstrate proficiency in designing and writing programs. The programming language used is Java. 

February 2017 - June 2017
