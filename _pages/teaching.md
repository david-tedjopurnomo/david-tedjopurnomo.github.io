### [Programming Bootcamp 1 (COSC2801)](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/054079)

### RMIT University

This course introduces programming in a bootcamp style using Java. This course covers algorithmic development using standard control structures, fundamental concepts of programming and creation of small to medium practical applications. In this course students will learn the basic skills of program development by working on the production of small amounts of software. This will include skills in testing and debugging programs, and in the use of appropriate software technologies. 

Achieved a 4.02 out of 5.00 mean Good Teaching Score (GTS). Exceeding the school, college and RMIT mean GTS score.
