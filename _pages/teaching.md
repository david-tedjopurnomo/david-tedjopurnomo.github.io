### [Spatial Data Management (GEOM90008)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/geom90008)

### The University of Melbourne 

This subject combines practical spatial data management with the underpinning theories of spatial and spatiotemporal data representation and handling from Geographic Information Science. Students will learn the foundation sof effective, efficient and large-scale spatial data management in both theory in the form of face-to-face lectures and practice in the form of hands-on exercises on weekly laboratories, covering GIS softwares such as PGAdmin and QGIS, as well as the conceptual and logical spatial database design. 

February 2024 - June 2024
